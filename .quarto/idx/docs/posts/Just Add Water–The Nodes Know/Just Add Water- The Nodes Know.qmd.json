I don’t consider myself to have much of a green thumb but, this **angiosperm** (Prakash et al., 2016) is definitely helping my image! In this article we will explore an overview of why these little guys are so viable in water and how the molecular mechanisms of nodes in conjunction with the plant’s vegetative organs facilitate successful propagation in water.\n\nBefore getting into the workings of plant nodes we must first establish vital context and for this we will take a bird’s eye view of the plant and gradually zoom in, until we get to the molecular mechanisms as the article(s) progress. Nodes are located on the stems of most plants; stems, leaves and roots are all referred to as vegetative tissue (Rost et al., 1984). Vegetative organs of plants are the drivers of nutrition and growth; they are not responsible for reproductive processes however, they collectively prepare the plant to fulfil its reproductive cycle. \n\nRoots absorb water and minerals from the growth media (soil, water, agar, etc.);\n\n![**Figure 2.

Have you stared at a plant long enough to notice how its leaves grow on its stem? They vary by plant, however leaves are generally derived by nodal cells at variable intervals on the plant’s stem. The lengths of these intervals are not necessarily standard, but specific to the plant in question. **The location where leaves protrude from the stem is called a node** (Rost et al., 1984). The space between two nodes is called an **internode** (Rost et al., 1984).\n\n![**Figure 7. Mint nodes (blue), mint internodes (red).**](images/Screenshot 2024-07-22 220140.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\nNodal cells are considered to be **meristematic** (undifferentiated) (Buchanan et al., 2015), this indicates that some factor can influence its functionality.  In the instance of this mint propagation experiment series,  the removal of lower leaves\n\n![**Figure 8. Mint stem cuttings with lower leaves removed**](images/Screenshot 2024-07-22 220223.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n\n and water submersion of those stems\n\n![**Figure 9.
