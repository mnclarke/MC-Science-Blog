    "text": "“emergence”\n/ɪˈməːdʒ(ə)ns/\nnoun\nthe process of becoming visible after being concealed.\n–Oxford Languages\nTo truly end the suffering is to accept the change. Blindly. Bravely. With no expectations besides the “end”. This is where freedom begins.\nThere’s never any talk of the chrysalis arc of the cycle… it’s always the beginning and the end but never the unfiltered realities of the in-between. Never any mention of the most absolute and gut wrenching suffering you might ever go through in your entire life.\nAs a young caterpillar you settle in, settle down with visions of floating on the wind on your earned wings; you’re beautiful and life is as it should be in your eyes. At ease and excited for the future you ease into the resting place for the old you, relaxed and ready to go through the changes in your coffin and womb–chrysalis.\nThis is not as it seems? The shapeshifting to face the world on your own terms is not as easy as you thought it would be, right? Still you hold onto your vision as your insides disintegrate… you became nothing. Nothing becomes everything when you realise that you have to build the vision from it; sifting blindly through the endless and often painful parts of everything that is your universe in that moment in an attempt to create the path to that vision of you floating on the wind. You finally understand the phrase “searching for a needle in a haystack” but you stick to it anyway, confused and terrified facing the threats of life in your incredibly vulnerable state.\nA wind blown too strongly, a thunderstorm gone wrong, a careless child playing too freely. You made it through. You survived it all whilst trying to piece together your vision with nothing more than who you are.\nYou did it, the chrysalis cracks at last. The cold coffin for your soul, sealed by superficiality to contain your warmth… your light. You get a feel of your future now that the frigidly filtered glamour is broken.\nFresh to the world around you, recovering into your new-self, the air seems warmer than you remembered. It’s easier to breathe, the air can finally touch your soul. Recovering into your new-self you find your wings to be weak. It frustrates you as you try to fly. Why is it still so hard? You made the changes. You went through hell to get there and yet it was still so hard. You don’t give up though, you went through all of that trauma and grew those wings from it in the cold, of course they’re not ready to fly in the sun just yet. Push too hard and you’ll destroy them, give up and it would’ve all been for nothing so you pace yourself and wait on the wind that was meant for you.\nYou finally catch that wind that feels like it was destined for you, a written in the stars kind of perfection, at last you understand that you built your wings blindly for this wind. Every lesson you learned was to help you float on this wind. You coast on your wind, perfectly in tune with the world around you, the changes that you made in that chrysalis to fall into flow with nature has finally shown their purpose.\nIn that moment you suddenly realise that you are free and that true freedom lies in having the choice to change. True freedom is being able to choose to emerge.\nThe Painting\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Painting Explained\nThe chrysalis\nThe chrysalis in this painting was painted in a variance of cool greys. These fragments were painted from reference of stained glass pieces, representative of the often cold and colourless beauty of the ideologies that are implemented from infancy. The fragments that never quite blended together were forced together with gold, the tempting and blinding adhesive that holds the fragile things together.\nEach highlight on each fragment contains four layers: the four liberal arts and sciences that complete the world, the classical four elements, the four seasons. Each layer equally as relevant to the fabric of reality.\nThe butterfly\nThe monarch butterfly consumes the poisonous milkweed during their larval stage and it is then stored in its body indefinitely. The poison, cardiac glycosides, causes predators to vomit, but it rarely ever causes death. The nourishment during development serves a purpose in the entire life cycle whether it realises this or not.\nThe brightly red hued wings of the Monarch Butterfly acts as a “warning sign” to deter hungry predators.\nThe colour red was the focus of this painting because holistic healing begins at the root chakra which is represented by the colour red. Located at the base of the spine, the pelvic floor, and the first three vertebrae, the root chakra is responsible for your sense of safety and security on this earthly journey. The word Muladhara breaks down into two Sanskrit words: Mula meaning “root” and Adhara, which means “support” or “base.” An unbalanced root chakra is often associated with anxiety disorders, fears and nightmares. Balancing this first energy centre creates a solid foundation for the chakra above it to be healed. Red was also important in this painting due to the fact that the lowest wavelength observed in the visible light spectrum is red. It was only fitting symbolically that the first painting in this series be red since it is the lowest limit of the human eye’s colour perception.\nThe stem\nThe styling of the stem was completely intuitive and was left open to interpretation given that the stem in itself is representative of the universe, the creator, God etc. That one entity that supported the development of the butterfly without interfering, it was a constant.\nThe background\nThe white background is a composition of all of the aspects of visible light being reflected, this energy used to fuel the necessary change. The varying hues of red pulsating through the white at the crack of the glamour, freeing the energy that was pent up into the surrounding.\nWhat are your interpretations? How does my perspective help you fine tune your own?\nReference images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst published: Here on March 17, 2022"

    "text": "Just Add Water–The Nodes Know\n\nAn overview of the involvement of nodes in Mentha L. sp propagation\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Mentha L. sp. (Mint)\n\n\n\nMint (Mentha L. sp.) classification (USDA Plants database, n.d):\nKingdom: Plantae- Plant\nSubkingdom: Tracheobionta- Vascular plant\nSuperdivision: Spermatophyta- Seed plant\nDivision: Magnoliophyta- Flowering plant\nClass: Magnoliopsida- Dicotyledon\nSubclass: Asteridae\nOrder: Lamiale\nFamily: Lamiaceae Martinov- Mint family\nGenus: Mentha L.\n\nMint (Mentha L.) is a flowering plant whose physiology and genetics allows it to be easily multiplied and nursed by novice gardeners (like myself). I don’t consider myself to have much of a green thumb but, this angiosperm (Prakash et al., 2016) is definitely helping my image! In this article we will explore an overview of why these little guys are so viable in water and how the molecular mechanisms of nodes in conjunction with the plant’s vegetative organs facilitate successful propagation in water.\nBefore getting into the workings of plant nodes we must first establish vital context and for this we will take a bird’s eye view of the plant and gradually zoom in, until we get to the molecular mechanisms as the article(s) progress. Nodes are located on the stems of most plants; stems, leaves and roots are all referred to as vegetative tissue (Rost et al., 1984). Vegetative organs of plants are the drivers of nutrition and growth; they are not responsible for reproductive processes however, they collectively prepare the plant to fulfil its reproductive cycle. \nRoots absorb water and minerals from the growth media (soil, water, agar, etc.);\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Mint roots following propagation.\n\n\nleaves facilitate photosynthetic processes;\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Mint leaves (removed from stem for water propagation)\n\n\nstems transport nutrients and water between organs as well as “sprout” new leaves and flowers;\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Mint stems (clipped from plant for propagation)\n\n\nthe shoot apex is the origin of leaf formation as well as all new cells on the plant’s shoot;\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Shoot apex of mint shoot. \n\n\nthe root apex produces all new cells on the plant’s root.\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Mint root apex. \n\n\nNow that we’ve set the macroscopic stage, we can adjust our focus to the star of this article: the node. Have you stared at a plant long enough to notice how its leaves grow on its stem? They vary by plant, however leaves are generally derived by nodal cells at variable intervals on the plant’s stem. The lengths of these intervals are not necessarily standard, but specific to the plant in question. The location where leaves protrude from the stem is called a node (Rost et al., 1984). The space between two nodes is called an internode (Rost et al., 1984).\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Mint nodes (blue), mint internodes (red).\n\n\nNodal cells are considered to be meristematic (undifferentiated) (Buchanan et al., 2015), this indicates that some factor can influence its functionality.  In the instance of this mint propagation experiment series,  the removal of lower leaves\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Mint stem cuttings with lower leaves removed\n\n\n and water submersion of those stems\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Mint stem cuttings submerged in water for propagation\n\n\nwill trigger signals for root formation (differentiation) mechanisms at the exposed nodes. \n\n\n\nFigure 10. Roots grown from propagated stem nodes (Mint).\n\n\nThese nodal cells were influenced by the mint’s vegetative tissue, namely the leaves and shoot apex, to initiate root formation in order for successful propagation to occur. Next week we will continue our molecular investigation of Mentha L. sp. propagation; in the subsequent posts we will adjust our lenses to understand the intricate mechanics of Mint propagation in water. \n\n\nQuestions to ponder until next time:\n\nWhat exactly are leaves?\nWhy do they need light?\nWhy does the light requirement vary by plant?\nWhere does the energy harvested through light ultimately go?\n\nTake care,\nMpule Clarke.\n\n\nReferences\nBuchanan, B.

    "text": "Just Add Water–The Leaves Are Up\n\nA review on the involvement of leaves in Mentha L. sp propagation\n                                            \n\n\n\nFigure 1. Mentha L. sp. (Mint)\n\n\nMint (Mentha L. sp.) classification (USDA Plants database, n.d):\nKingdom: Plantae- Plant\nSubkingdom: Tracheobionta- Vascular plant\nSuperdivision: Spermatophyta- Seed plant\nDivision: Magnoliophyta- Flowering plant\nClass: Magnoliopsida- Dicotyledon\nSubclass: Asteridae\nOrder: Lamiale\nFamily: Lamiaceae Martinov- Mint family\nGenus: Mentha L.\nWelcome back to another instalment of the ‘Just Add Water’ series on MC Science Blog. This article will answer the questions posed in my last post. The review will explain the functionality of leaves, why they need light, why their light requirements are so particular; and the pathway of energy transfer after photon absorption.\nTo understand terrestrial plants we must truly appreciate how (frankly) weird and highly organised they are. Leaves, for instance, serve as energy harvesting sites on the plants; they are akin to solar panels on a home. Technical and organised systems that convert sunlight into energy that can be efficiently utilised by the encoded systems within. This interdisciplinary junction is where an appreciation of concepts in physics brings its usual enlightenment. Under the law of conservation of energy, where the universe is a “closed system”, and the sun and the plants are objects within this system possessing the capacity to form interactions with each other. Understanding that within the universe energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but converted from one form to the next, it can now be appreciated that energy expelled by the sun and then absorbed by the leaves of the (terrestrial) plant is only being converted into a form that is useful to terrestrial mechanisms. In the case of our experiment, the leaves of Mentha L. (indirectly) provide energy to the node cells for root formation to be facilitated; much like the solar panels on a building will provide energy to your device for you to be able to read this article. The idea is the same however, the mechanisms are different. \nNothing can occur in a cell (organism) without energy transfers; significant quantities of energy are required for the expression of a single gene. Energy is needed for: releasing the compact gene segment on the condensed chromosome; activating the transcription factors; initiating transcription; capping the transcript; elongating the transcript (these nitrogenous bases are in the form of energy rich triphosphates that are polymerized as monophosphates, releasing thousands of pyrophosphate bonds at 𝚫G°-33.4 kJ/mol (Buchanan et al., 2015) each!); terminating transcription with a tail of approximately two hundred adenosine triphosphate units (a reaction that releases an approximated 6,680 kJ/mol per cell for a single transcription cycle); transporting the transcript out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm for exon splicing, ribosomal translation, protein packaging etc.. It is safe to infer that a lot of energy is needed by cells to execute their basic functionings, especially when we consider that one transcript termination cycle in one hour requires the energy transfer of approximately 1789.82 watts. A single gene can be expressed in as little a time as a couple of seconds (Alpert et al. 2016), and this gene will be expressed several times for mass production of the required protein in several cells in the organism. For reference, the energy required for observable changes in a plant will be enough to power multiple houses for several hours.\nThe clarity of my previous tangent leads to the question ‘How exactly are these things able to capture sunlight and turn it into so much usable energy?!’. The light harnessing sites of leaves are strategically positioned on specialised membranes within these little plastids called chloroplasts. Plastids, to date, are believed to be endosymbionts (Buchanan et al., 2015) that higher plants smartly utilised for adaptation to increase the productivity of their endogenic mechanisms. These oxygenic photosynthetic plastids are packaged neatly with a double membrane enveloping ribosomes, genetic material, stacks (granum) of thylakoids containing many protein bound chlorophyll molecules. \n\n\n\nFigure 2. Diagram of the chloroplast of green terrestrial plants (Mandal & Dutta, 2020)\n\n\nThe name ‘chloro’-‘plast’ now becomes self-explanatory; the chlorophyll molecules within these plastids are the driver for all light harvesting activities. Chlorophyll is a porphyrin ring molecule, with a magnesium core. Magnesium has an electronic configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2; within the chlorophyll molecules magnesium exists as Mg2+. \n\n\n\nFigure 3. Structure of the typical chlorophyll molecule (Mandal & Dutta, 2020)\n\n\nThe two valence electrons in the 3s orbital are unbound and excitable to higher energy states, making the energy harvesting capacity of the molecule (when bound to chlorophyll binding proteins in the thylakoid membrane) quite efficient for photons of wavelengths which align with the possible excitation energy states of the Mg2+ ion. \nChlorophyll binding proteins are expressed by chloroplast DNA, these proteins when combined into subunits make up the energy harvesting system (referred to as a Photosystem). These proteins are all endogenous to the plastid and NOT the plant’s chromosomal DNA. Several chloroplast (photosystem related) genes such as PsbO, CP43, and CP26 (Drop et al., 2013) have been identified as conserved across several oxygenic photosynthetic species including the common ancestor Clamydomonas reinhardtii. The light harvesting complexes of these organisms are composed of a core containing the reaction centre (RC) where primary light harvesting occurs for the hydrolysis of water, as well as chloroplast and carotenoid antenna complexes that capture photons of varied wavelengths and transfer them to the RC (Drop et al., 2013). The outer antenna composition is thus predetermined by the cpDNA of the plant which is inherited in a non-mendelian manner. \nWhen a plant is exposed to photon wavelengths that are too high for their light harvesting apparatus these systems may get damaged and result in the halting of photosynthesis (Photoinhibition); which will kill the plant if repair is not possible, and the cells are not receiving sufficient energy. The antenna systems of plants, algae, and cyanobacteria (Ruban, 2016) expel the excess energy as heat. These organisms have adapted to escape the fate of damaged photosystems over time; however, climate change events (as well as incorrect planting techniques) challenge these evasive mechanisms.  This characteristic significantly contributes to the light tolerance of a plant; whether it is a heliophyte (light loving) or a sciophyte (shade loving). \nFollowing everything mentioned above, we can now acknowledge that in the chloroplast, photons from the sun are converted into primary metabolites that are compatible for exiting the plastid and participating in cellular reactions. Each plant has its own unique by-products, which infers that they have unique metabolic compositions and as such their energy requirements will vary. \nConsequently, the photosynthetic capacity and photoperiod of a plant significantly influences its economic value; the cost of growing a plant increases if your cultivation space requires adjustment to lighting for flowering to successfully occur, and for a sufficient fruit set and maturation to occur (for fruiting plants) or for optimal phytochemical yield (for herbs and medicinal crop).\n\n\nQuestions to ponder until next time:\n\nWhat is a primary metabolite and how does it contribute to observable changes in plants?\nHow do plants know when to express which genes?\nHow do these metabolites exit the chloroplast?\n\n\nTake care,\nMpule Clarke.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nAlpert, T., Herzel, L., & Neugebauer, K.
